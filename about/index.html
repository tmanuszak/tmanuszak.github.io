      <p class="indent">Hey, Trey Manuszak here. Most know me for my willingness to open and 
      explore the many doors that life throws at me. Below is a summary of those doors I've opened.</p>
      <hr>
      <section>
        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p class="indent">During my math undergrad, I took an elective 
        "Intro to Programming" class during the Spring 2018 semester, which 
        covered the basics of programming and the language <b>Java</b>.
        Just after quickly learning about loopsi, functions and arrays, 
        I started experimenting with my own programs. The first that I have 
        <a href="https://github.com/tmanuszak/HofstadterEquation">record</a> of, was 
        a program that found the <em>n</em>-th number in the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter_sequence#Hofstadter_Q_sequence">Hofstadter Q sequence</a>.
        You might be thinking that's quite a handful for a first big jump into programming
        and it surprises me too! Although, it wasn't the mathematical complexity 
        that was tough to grapple with, but the programming of finding elements 
        in an array according to other elements in the same array.</p>
        <p class=indent>You might also be thinking that it is quite an esoteric program to 
        implement for a first timer, but I was reading 
        <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">G&#246del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</a></em> 
        by Douglas Hofstadter at the time of taking this class. It is a book that 
        has influenced much of my curiosity for highly abstract ideas today. Hofstadter's 
        book explores the notions of self-reference being the basis for consciousness 
        through the mathematics introduced by G&#246del, etchings by Escher, and 
        music composed by Bach.
        </p>

        <p class="indent">Although the course left me highly interested in the field, 
        I didn't take any further computer science courses during my undergrad. 
        But that doesn't mean mean I stopped programming! During my free time, I 
        would work on <a href="projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problems, which are challenging 
        math problems that require a cleverly crafted program to solve. Without 
        any formal knowledge to algorithms or data structures, I ended up getting into
        the top 1% of solvers on the site (although I sit just outside since I haven't 
        been solving in a while)!</p>

        </div>

        <p class="indent">Following my undergrad in math and short experimentation in secondary education,
        I got an opportunity for a software developer internship at Asure Software. There,
        I primarily worked on developing a web application in <b>C#</b> for 
        PGP file encryption and SFTP using the <b>.NET</b> platform. This was my
        first introduction to the world of cryptography, which I am highly 
        passionate about now. Also at the internship, I built a class library 
        for interacting with the Goldman Sachs Transaction Banking API for seamless 
        ACH payments. Lastly, I worked with my mentor to rewrite the existing payroll 
        tax management system database schema for a future company-wide transition 
        to a <b>PostgreSQL</b> database schema.
