		<h1>Game Theory and its Influence on Randomized Algorithms</h1>
	</header>
	<hr>

	<article>
		<p class="indent">
			In my last semester of graduate school, I attended a 
			“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm">Randomized</a> 
			and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximation_algorithm">Approximation</a> 
			Algorithms” course. It was by far the most rigorous course in my graduate studies 
			and reminded me a great deal of the difficulty of my courses I took during 
			my undergrad in Mathematics. There was one particular topic in the randomized 
			algorithms section that stood out as fascinating and profound. <b>There 
			is only one known method of lower bounding the expected performance of 
			randomized algorithms and it comes from famous results in 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory">game theory</a>.</b> 
			This particular section did not come easy to me as I had no experience with game theory. 
			In fact, the whole course was an uphill battle as I had not done any of the three 
			required prerequisites that are “Combinatorial Algorithms”, “Foundations of Algorithms”, 
			and “Theory of Computation”. Most of the class relied HEAVILY on statistics, which I 
			had not formally taken either. I saw the course as a final boss battle to test my limits. 
			Anyway, I wanted to break this interesting topic as I grappled with it as someone who 
			tried to learn it with little foundational experience.
		</p>
		<h2>Game Theory Basics</h2>
		<p class="indent">
			Game theory provides a formal language for the representation and analysis 
			of situations where several entities take rational actions that affect each other 
			[Bonanno, 2018]. Imagine a game of rock, paper, scissors with the standard rules 
			between two players, Robert and Charles. We can represent this game from the 
			perspective of Robert as what is called a payoff matrix. Each row of the matrix 
			represents a strategy available to Robert and each column represents a strategy 
			available to Charles. For our payoff matrix \(P\), which we can find in <b>Figure 1</b>, 
			the component \(P_{i,j}\) represents the amount that Charles pays to Robert when 
			Robert chooses strategy \(i\) and Charles chooses strategy \(j\).

			This is an example of what is called a <em>two-person zero-sum game</em>. 
			That is, the net amount won by Robert and Charles is exactly zero. 
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
			Now, notice that Robert, the row player, wants to maximize the payoff, 
			while Charles, the column player, wants to minimize the payoff. If 
			neither player has information about what the opposing player wants to play, 
			and Robert chooses strategy \(i\), then he is guaranteed to win at least the 
			smallest payoff in row \(i\), no matter what Charles chooses. Similarly, if 
			Charles chooses strategy \(j\), then he is guaranteed to win at most the 
			largest payoff in column \(j\), no matter what Robert’s strategy is. Since 
			Robert wants to maximize the payoff, an optimal strategy for Robert, we denote 
			\(\mathcal{O}_R\), is to choose the strategy \(i\) that maximizes \(\min_j P_{i,j}\). 
			Similarly, since Charles wants to minimize the payoff, an optimal strategy for 
			Charles, we denote \(\mathcal{O}_C\), is to choose the strategy \(j\) that 
			minimizes \(\max_i P_{i,j}\).
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
			In simpler terms, each player is choosing the strategy that satisfies their 
			respective statement from the following:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>Robert: For each row, find the smallest payoff. Choose the strategy 
				that is the largest of these.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Charles: For each column, find the largest payoff. Choose the strategy 
				that is the smallest of these.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="indent">
			The strategy chosen will be their optimal strategy. For <b>Figure 1</b>, we have 
			\(\mathcal{O} _R = -1\) and \(\mathcal{O}_C = 1\). When these two are equal, the 
			game is said to have a solution and the value of the game is 
			\(V = \mathcal{O}_R = \mathcal{O}_C\). 
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
			Now, let’s change up the payoff matrix. Say we are playing rock, paper, scissors, 
			where the payoff is denoted in <b>Figure 2</b>. In <span style="color: #FF8360;">red</span>, 
			I have highlighted the 
			smallest payoff in each row. Robert chooses the largest of these, which is 
			underlined in his strategies. I have highlighted <span style="color: #E8E288">yellow</span> 
			in each column the 
			largest payoff. Charles will choose the strategy with the largest of these values, 
			which is underlined in his strategies as well. Notice that now, this game has a 
			solution of \(V = 1\). It isn’t a very fun game for Charles, since the 
			best he can do is always pay Robert $1, but it is the best option if forced to play.
			Neither player has any incentive to deviate from their strategy.

			Up until now, we have only considered what is called <em>pure strategies</em>. 
			That is, choosing exactly one strategy and sticking to it. However, what if 
			our strategy was chosen randomly from some distribution? This is called 
			<em>mixed strategies</em>. If the payoff matrix \(P\) is of dimension \(n \times m\), 
			then Robert’s probability distribution is a column vector \(\boldsymbol{p} = (p_1, \dots, p_n)\), 
			from which he will choose a strategy \(i\) with probability \(p_i\). 
			Similarly, Charles’ probability distribution is a column vector 
			\(\boldsymbol{q} = (q_1, \dots, q_m)\), from which he will choose a strategy 
			\(j\) with probability \(q_j\). Thus, we have \[\begin{aligned} \mathcal{O}_R &= 
			\max_\boldsymbol{p} \min_\boldsymbol{q} \boldsymbol{p}^T P \boldsymbol{q}, \\ 
			\mathcal{O}_C &= \min_\boldsymbol{q} \max_\boldsymbol{p} \boldsymbol{p}^T P \boldsymbol{q}.\end{aligned}\]

			Now, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von Neumann</a>

					\min_\boldsymbol{q} \max_\boldsymbol{p} \boldsymbol{p}^T P \boldsymbol{q}.\]
