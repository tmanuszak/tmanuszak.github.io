      <img class="big-img" src="https://imagedelivery.net/kpjDIZy0BT0VX-Cr6PcgqA/02ec3092-2366-4885-2062-d1c8aa7c6400/public" />
      <p class="indent">
        Let's get some potpourri topics out of the way before diving into my
        trip to the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea"
          >Democratic People's Republic of Korea</a
        >, or more commonly known as North Korea. I often feel the need to
        justify my travel to North Korea when I tell anybody that I went. One
        concern I get from people is the safety of travel, as people often think
        of the case of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Warmbier">Otto Warmbier</a>.
        I have to say, experiencing the country first hand, there is absolutely
        no way he did not know the consequences of his unfortunate actions. I
        will talk about reasons for this later, but I want to put that out there
        now. This also does not mean I believe he was deserving of the
        punishment he got. I feel awful for his loved ones that had to live that
        experience. I absolutely understand that they are a ruthless and
        terrible regime.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Second, I often have to justify that my trip provided some amount of
        direct funding to the regime. I'll say this. My trip only cost $1,060
        for five days and four nights. That included food, accommodation,
        transportation within the country, entrance fees, and anything else I
        did within the country. Whatever might be left after subtracting that
        from the total, along with whatever my tour company takes home (they are
        not North Korean by the way), and my Australian and American guide's
        salary, is maybe going to the regime. It's not going to buy their next
        ICBM, that's for sure. Anyway, many people don't know it is likely some
        nonzero amount of their spending each year goes to the regime when the
        products they buy are getting their manufacturing outsourced from China
        to North Korea

      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Third, I believe, if possible, it is incredibly important for people to
        experience the effects of human rights atrocities first hand. From
        visiting a death camp, or visiting a totalitarian country, it is
        important for people in much better off parts of the world to realize
        just how awful the world can be. It's often a much needed wakeup call
        because in my experience, the venn diagram of similarities and
        differences between a country like the US and North Korea overlap much
        more than you think and there are really not a lot of steps or actions
        that can be taken before making the overlap whole. Admittedly, I did not
        have this view before visiting the country, but it is one of my few
        foundational beliefs now. If my three points of justification still
        upsets you reader, then we must just disagree, and I ultimately don't
        care if we do.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Okay, now for the fun trip report. First, how did I decide to go to
        North Korea? In 2016, I was not what you'd call a world traveler, having
        only been to Mexico and around the states, but I had been working hard
        at a local YMCA, saving for a year and a half at the time. This is just
        shortly after completing high school and certification in luthiery. I
        didn't really know what to do with my life at the time and was thinking
        about traveling for a few months to learn more about myself. I spent
        most of 2016 secretly planning where to go, not really telling anyone
        about my planned adventure until shortly before my departure.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        I remember reading earlier in the year about Otto and his attempted
        theft of a propaganda poster in North Korea. My first thought was “Hey,
        that's interesting. I didn't know you could go there. I wonder what it
        is like.” I extensively researched travel to North Korea and there are
        many options and tours and it looked like a thousand or so Americans,
        and many more foreigners visit every year through official guided tours
        (the only way to travel there). After much research on the safety of
        such travel, I personally concluded that Otto was quite negligent and it
        was perfectly safe to travel, if you followed clear judgment.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Of the few companies offering tours,
        <a href="https://www.youngpioneertours.com/">Young Pioneer Tours</a>
        (YPT), sounded the most experienced and professional. It was also much
        cheaper than I had expected and they offer many off-the-beaten path
        tours around the world, which I will for sure attend in the future. Stay
        tuned for that. I decided on the
        <a
          href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160416170638/http://www.youngpioneertours.com/tour/grand-national-day-2016"
          >Grand National Day Tour</a
        >. It occurs over their Grand National Day holiday, every 9th of
        September, which celebrates the founding of the country. Basically
        America's 4th of July. As you may imagine, it is one of the most festive
        and important days of the year for them. Festivities include
        performances, fireworks, mass dancing, sporting events, and military
        parades. Sounded like a great time, so sign me up!

      <h2>Day -3: September 4, 2016</h2>
      <p class="indent">
        I start my trip report on this day because there is quite an interesting
        North Korea predicament I got myself into. First, I arrived at Sky
        Harbor airport ready to depart on my four month long journey around the
        globe! My layover on my way to Beijing was Seattle. While I was in
        Seattle and made my way to check in for my flight to China, there was an
        issue. I intended to use what was at the time
        <a href="https://www.travelchinaguide.com/embassy/visa/free-72hour/"
          >China's 72-hour visa-free travel</a
        >
        within Beijing. There were quite a few constraints to using this though.
        You had to stay within the Beijing city limits and you had to be
        traveling onward to a country different from the one you came from. As
        you might imagine, it doesn't get much use. I was nervous about using it
        though since I would not be given my flight information to North Korea
        until the day before. I was worried about proving my departure. After
        some research online and speaking to my YPT tour company beforehand,
        apparently it's never been an issue at the gate before departure. It is
        rarely an issue at customs in China, and when it is, they still let you
        in after a few minutes of understanding.
      </p>
      <div class="third">
        <img class="third-img" src="https://imagedelivery.net/kpjDIZy0BT0VX-Cr6PcgqA/8332d41e-53cb-46ca-775e-d43498e09800/public" />
        <img class="third-img" src="https://imagedelivery.net/kpjDIZy0BT0VX-Cr6PcgqA/270f0c5c-243f-4d32-10db-43a559760b00/public" />
        <img class="third-img" src="https://imagedelivery.net/kpjDIZy0BT0VX-Cr6PcgqA/bae77709-e614-4bfe-5f50-c94157547700/public" />
      </div>
      <p class="indent">
        With my luck it was absolutely an issue with the gate attendant before
        my flight and she was not budging. After texting with my American guide
        in China, she drafted an official looking letter on my behalf hopefully
        good enough to let me pass.
      </p>
      <img class="big-img" src="https://imagedelivery.net/kpjDIZy0BT0VX-Cr6PcgqA/26cacf86-1fdc-4f27-6712-355d603d0000/public" />
      <p class="indent">
        Not even this would be enough to let me pass. With one hour to departure
        I was very nervous this would already foil my trip. The last resort my
        guide suggested was to buy the cheapest one-way flight out of Beijing to
        another country in the next three days. I obviously wouldn't take it,
        but it should be convincing enough to let me through. I found a $250
        one-way flight leaving for Hong Kong the next day from Beijing. I bought
        it and thankfully it was enough to let me on that plane to Beijing. The
        gate attendant was suspicious nonetheless though. I never had any issues
        at customs in China though!
      </p>

      <h2>Day -1: September 7, 2016</h2>
      <p class="indent">
        Our tour group had a pre-tour meeting at the City Line Hotel, near the
        Beijing Railway Station to discuss what to expect and ground rules. We
        discussed items we should leave behind, such as the obvious drugs and
        weapons, as well as the non-obvious items from religious paraphernalia
        to the recently released “<a
          href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2788710/"
          >The Interview</a
        >” movie. We were made aware that if we brought digital items, such as
        phones, laptops, or cameras, they may thoroughly check everything on
        there. Forgetting to remove any of the forbidden items from your device
        before arrival, wouldn't be enough to warrant punishment, but they will
        sternly demand you delete it in front of them. Better to over-exercise
        precaution if an item may be questionable. We were also notified that
        our phones and computers would not work within the country.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Topics of discussion were also on actions inside the country. These are
        pretty obvious what to do, not do, say, and not say. Otto was actually
        on a tour with my guides the year prior and was given the same very
        clear warnings. It was also demanded to stay within sight of your tour
        guides or on the hotel property for the entirety of the trip. As
        mentioned before, I had one Australian tour guide and one American on my
        trip, but I also had two North Korean tour guides, which we joined up
        with when entering the country. One was female, I unfortunately forget
        her name, was really in charge of leading our group, and was a real joy
        to be around. The other, a male, was stern and quiet, just following
        along. He was honestly probably just an agent to keep watch on us in his
        cool aviators.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        There were two non-obvious things you must do though. One, is that if
        you take a picture of their dear leaders, you must make sure you get the
        entire portrait or statue in frame. Failing to do so, our guides will
        ask you to delete and retake the picture. It happens to everyone at
        least once, including me, as it's easy to forget. The other non-obvious
        request is to not take pictures of the military personnel, which is
        predictable, but also construction workers. The reason for that, which
        was not obvious prior to arrival, is that almost all construction
        workers are military. If there was a military parade though, we would be
        allowed pictures. Great publicity! But, we never did get to see one.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        All of the rules to follow were fairly obvious and some of the most
        obvious that could be broken were clear to have consequences. It was
        also clear that some of the easier to forget rules would just have stern
        warnings and be understanding if accidentally broken. I really want to
        emphasize that it was not stressful at all during the trip to try to
        adhere to any of these rules.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        I was handed at this meeting my flight information and visa for entering
        the country, you can see below. Unfortunately, I don't get to keep this
        visa, and there is no stamping of my passport.

      <h2>Day 1: September 8, 2016</h2>
      <p class="indent">
        I arrived at the Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK) for my 2pm
        flight to Pyongyang International Airport on the North Korean airline
        <a href="http://www.airkoryo.com.kp/">Air Koryo</a>. The airline fleet
        consists of old soviet aircraft. It is apparently the

          >world's only one-star airline</a
        >. Judging by the picture I took of the inflight propaganda tunes played
        on the TVs and cross-referencing interior pictures I found online, it
        looks like I was on their Tupolev Tu-204 aircraft. Upon boarding the
        aircraft, I was offered an English version of the local Pyongyang Times,
        which I flipped through on the flight, and have it framed today.

        We landed and went through customs. Everybody all had the same nerve
        wracking thoughts as we went through and got our items searched,
        wondering if we thoroughly cleaned everything enough. The customs
        agents, who probably easily recognize the nervousness of every newcomer,
        liked to crack jokes and pretend they found forbidden materials. They
        had a dark humor that I found kind of funny and honestly oddly relieving

        Upon arrival at our hotel, we are met with the quite grand, mildly
        decorated for the holiday, and opulent-for-the-country hotel lobby. The
        hotel had many amenities any normal North Korean could never even dream
        of seeing. It has a revolving rooftop restaurant, banquet halls, gift
        shop, bowling alley, billiards room, sauna, swimming pool, barber shop,
        and a casino, which was considered territory of Macau for legal reasons.
        It even has a tailor shop where you can get a fitted suit, the same
        style as Kim Jong Un! It even has a karaoke bar where you can belt out
        your favorite North Korean tune, Bon Jovi's “Livin' On a Prayer”, or any
        other of your favorite American jams. You can actually see my Aussie

        As our guides were checking our group in at the front desk, we could see
        military personnel in full regalia come in and out of the hotel,
        occasionally stopping to chit chat or exchange words to each other. Most
        of them seemed to be of Russian, or ex-Soviet nationality. Maybe here to
        attend the festivities or attend classified meetings with their allies?
        There was an issue with checking our group in though. The front desk was
        adamant that the hotel was fully booked. This was clearly false since
        the hotel was just so massive and there are incredibly few tourists,
        even for the busiest of their holidays. It is just one of the many
        experiences we are to have in trying to convince us foreigners they are
        a prospering and bustling nation. After a little convincing, they
        magically found enough rooms for us. What a surprise \s!

        I chose not to pay extra for a room and got a roommate from my group. I
        don't remember the gentleman's name or occupation, but I recall him
        being from Italy. The room had two twin beds, an old radio, television,
        and probably many hidden bugged devices to listen to our conversations.

        I watched the television a bit during my stay and found it absolutely
        fascinating. If I recall, it was only a news channel. It was in korean,
        so I didn't understand what was said, but I vividly remember how
        dramatized and animated the female host was.

        Before I went to bed for the first night, I believe I was hanging out on
        the basement level, where many of the activities are, and took the
        elevator up to my room, which is at a fairly high level. Now, I had
        heard
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanggakdo_International_Hotel#The_Fifth_Floor"
          >rumors of the "missing" floors</a
        >
        in this hotel, that are supposedly replaced with rooms of surveillance
        equipment. I do recall the elevator having many missing floors to go to.
        Well, when I took the elevator up this first night, I was looking at my
        phone, not paying attention. The doors opened, I got out, and the doors
        shut behind me. I had not realized that it dropped me off on a dark
        floor. I pulled out my phone to film, in case anything went wrong, as I
        looked around the corner to see if there were any stairs, or to wait for
        the next one to hopefully come and pick me up. If you watch the video
        below, it may just look like a normal, maybe darker than usual floor
        without any context of a normal one. But, I assure you this was surely
        NOT a valid floor to be on. In hind sight, it may not have been a smart
        thing to look around the corner for stairs, which I did not find, but
        all was well and took the next elevator up.

        We were allowed inside though, only after giving up all of our
        belongings. Unfortunately, as such, I have no photos from the inside and
        they are very hard to come by on the internet. Below are some of the
        things I remember seeing inside. It was absolutely the most immaculate,
        beautiful, and quite impressive place I had ever seen, which, again, is
        quite sad given the nation's predicament and what this place is
        dedicated to.

        As estimates for the cost to build the mausoleum ranges between $100
        million and $1 billion, from my personal experience there, I'd easily
        peg it on the higher end of the scale. Words can't describe how huge it
        is either, other than saying it is 115,000 square feet. Inside are rooms
        full of memorabilia, personal belongings, and even rooms (PLURAL!)
        dedicated to awards and medals received from foreign dignitaries. Medals
        and gifts from everyone you can imagine, even US presidents. It even
        holds Kim Jong Il's personal car, boat, and train carriage on display.
        We were there for three hours and still barely saw everything.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Out of all things on display there, two are burned in my mind forever.
        We walk into two separate giant marble rooms outlined with fresh
        bouquets of flowers. In the first room, up on the top floor, lies the
        embalmed body of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Il-sung">Kim Il Sung</a>
        lying in state in a glass sarcophagus, and the body of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-il">Kim Jong Il</a> in
        the second room on the lower level. Military personnel were
        strategically positioned and at the ready, as if they were guarding
        America's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, or a member of the Royal Guard of
        Buckingham Palace. We were instructed beforehand what we were instructed
        to do in these rooms.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        We walk in one at a time, arms to our side, approaching the feet of the
        leaders first, and perform a long, slow, and deep bow before them. Then,
        you walk around to their left side, and again deeply bow. Walking around
        to the top, by their heads, you pass, rounding the final corner.
        Finally, around to their right side and perform your final bow. With
        each turn around the glass sarcophaguses, you stare deeply into the
        perfectly preserved face, as if they are just sleeping, of the two
        people responsible for some of the most reprehensible crimes against
        humanity. I took absolutely not a single amount of joy bowing to them,
        but felt it was incredibly important to see the first-person point of
        view face of a person capable of such evil. It carries different weight
        and meaning to see the person, rather than a black and white grainy
        photo in a book. It is easy to attach the atrocities they committed to
        their name, or photograph, but to see the face and be able to better
        attribute the horrors to the person as you physically stare at them just
        feet away is quite surreal.

        Following the mausoleum experience, we headed for a short drive south
        down the river to the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okryu-gwan">Okryu Restaurant</a>
        for lunch. Sitting on the river bank, it is one of the most iconic
        restaurants around town. The main dish served is raengmyon (cold
        noodles). Other dishes include jijim (green bean pancake), onban (rice
        with beef soup), and jongol (beef casserole). I'm going to be honest, I
        consider myself to have a fairly decent appetite for trying foreign
        cuisine, but I did not eat much this trip. It was difficult to stomach
        anything more than just a taste of most dishes. I often opted for the
        cold noodles when possible, which seemed to be palatable enough until a
        hopefully more fulfilling meal or snack later on. Looking back many
        years later, I wish I had taken more photographs of this trip. I
        unfortunately don't have any of this restaurant or meal, but I found
        some online that reminded me of the experience (below).

        After our joyous walk in the park, our North Korean handlers had gotten
        word through the phone that we had a rare opportunity to go off schedule
        and attend a performance! We rushed our way over to a large theater
        close by to watch acrobats fly gracefully through the air, diving into a
        pool below for synchronized swimming, and proudly belt songs of the
        homeland along the way. It was quite an impressive performance,
        understandably so as these performers were likely trained for such work
        starting at a few years old.

        After finishing the performance, we made our way to Mansudae Fountain
        Park to participate and watch festive mass dances with local Soong Ui
        College students. All men were in their white shirts with black ties and
        pants, while the women wore their colorful Hanboks. You of course can't
        go anywhere in the country without the portraits of the Eternal Leaders
        watching from above.

        After the sun had set on the dances and the day, we headed back on the
        tour bus, off to visit Kwangbok Department Store. One absolutely
        incredible event happened on our way to the store. Our bus got
        rear-ended by a pickup truck carrying construction workers. Looking back
        at this trip it still blows my mind that this happened, because the
        roads are just so extremely desolate, this has to be such a rare
        experience. The truck that hit us actually fled the scene. After getting
        out and observing the damage, seen below, our North Korean guides were
        quick to recognize the situation and huddled us back on the bus to avoid
        us taking pictures of the mishap. We eventually arrived at the
        department store, but they took the bus away from us and replaced it
        with another for the rest of the trip, despite the minor dings, probably
        to keep up the appearance of perfection in the country.

        This department store is dedicated to the rich and elite locals of
        Pyongyang, who look to satisfy their foreign and premium goods desires.
        I have a photo of the outside, but there are no pictures allowed on the
        inside. The interior pictures below can be found on the web. I have to
        imagine it is to not make it evident to the rest of the world they can
        fairly easily skirt out most trade restrictions. I saw many premium
        brands and goods, from Jack Daniels to Oreos to Whirlwind appliances.

        I'm unsure if the locals I saw shopping were for show or real, since we
        were trading in the store with the “official” exchange rate, which is
        many magnitudes stronger than the black market rate everybody commonly
        uses. Many people probably don't realize that the North Korean regime
        has lost control of their currency, or at least the rate they want
        everybody to use. The famine that ravaged the country in the mid to late
        90s, known locally as the “<a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_famine"
          >Arduous March</a
        >”, is one of the most devastating accounts of famine in human history.
        Estimates peg the famine related fatalities wiped out nearly ten percent
        of the entire population. Since the government was only reserving food
        for the few elite at the time, while many people were resorting to
        cannibalism, black markets flourished and the regime lost their
        widespread economic control of the populace. Still, with the famine so
        fresh in the public's minds, these black markets are still regularly
        used by everyday citizens to this day. There is a widespread culture of
        harsh punishment and snitching between friends, family, and neighbors
        within the country still, but black market trade is largely considered a
        norm and allowed.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Now is a good point for me to mention that although I didn't see
        massively impoverished people as we primarily stayed in the city limits
        of Pyongyang, moreso the best parts of it, I could tell, while glancing
        at towns far off the roadside, watching people bathe in absolutely
        disgusting creeks, and witnessing some severely malnourished country
        folk, that the human condition and lifestyle is still at an incredibly
        depressing level. I would like to talk more about this topic, but I do
        not believe I understood and saw enough of it to give the topic the
        justice and nuance it needs.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        What I am sure of, is that foreign media outlets do not know and/or tell
        the full picture. There are many levels of deception between what goes
        on in the country of North Korea, and what a foreign citizen, say from
        the US, might hear. The media and elite within North Korea of course do
        not want to know, hear about, or report on what real life is like in
        their country. They of course lie to foreign news outlets on conditions.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Then, we have to further deal with what our outlets decide to report or
        lie to us about as well. Some of the outlandish tales you hear about the
        country are for sure real, while others are laughable even to the local
        North Koreans. You can choose to believe me or not, but in my chats with
        the locals, they think it's funny Americans believe that North Koreans
        revere a supposed rumor that Kim Jong Il scores a 34 on a round of golf.
        One of my biggest gripes about the many American journalists that
        publish a “tell all” about their “dAngErOus eScaPE!” during their North
        Korean visit and having to stick their thumb drives up their ass to
        sneak their “SuPEr SecReT NeveR beFoRE SEEn PhoTOs!” out of the country.
        It's laughable and completely negligent journalism because it does not
        help the North Koreans actually get the help or understanding of the
        conditions they need from the rest of the world.

        If anyone wants a stellar deep dive into the true living conditions with
        little barriers between the source material and book, I highly recommend

        We finish our long and exhausting day with a visit to North Korea's

      <h2>Day 2: September 10, 2016</h2>
      <p class="indent">
        Early in the morning after our hotel breakfast, we headed to the famous
        bronze
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansu_Hill_Grand_Monument"
          >Mansu Hill Grand Monument</a
        >
        of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il to pay respects. The mural in the
        backdrop of the monuments displays Mount Paektu, which is one of the
        most iconic symbols in North Korea. It represents the mythological
        birthplace of the Korean people and of Korean ancestry. On both sides
        stood a large featuring a collage of people from the Worker's party and
        their anti-Japanese revolution with a backdrop of a waving communist
        flag. For such an important holiday, it was quite a barren and empty
        concrete platform, overlooking the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_to_Party_Founding"
          >Worker's Party Foundation Monument</a

        across the river, which we will visit later.

        Our next visit is just down the road south to the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_People%27s_Study_House"
          >Grand People's Study House</a
        >. It is a large library home to many documents, pamphlets, and
        manuscripts contributing to the study of the Dear Leaders,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche">Juche</a>
        philosophy, and North Korean history. The library even has many
        computers to access the North Korean intranet and radios to listen to
        past speeches. Below I have many photos I took from inside.

        We then made our way to the balcony of the library, which overlooks Kim
        Il Sung square and the Juche tower directly in view across the river. It
        is from this balcony you have likely seen the many videos and
        photographs of the military parades roll through with large ICBMs
        strapped to vehicles.

        Of course, we couldn't exit the library without first going through the
        gift shop. It was here that I purchased many postcards, a book titled
        “On the Juche Idea and the Korean People's Struggle for its Application”
        by Kim Il Sung, and even a propaganda poster. Yes, I purchased a
        propaganda poster, which we knew before the trip we would be able to do
        so. I want to emphasize this just to make it clear that Otto was
        malicious and negligent in his intent to steal one instead. This book I
        purchased is one of hundreds “authored” by Kim Il Sung about the Juche
        philosophy. I also took a photo, but regret not purchasing it now, of
        one humorously titled book “The Great Man of the Century” by the man
        himself, Kim Il Sung. If he's authoring it, why limit it to just the
        century? Who has him beat on the millennium?

        We left the library and had a walk around the square below. You can see
        the many marks on the ground for positions on where to stand or march
        for the parades. One thing you may notice in many pictures so far is
        just how barren the roads are. Pyongyang is obviously the busiest in car
        traffic in the country, but it is still astonishingly empty and eerie.
        One building of prominence lining the square is the Worker's Party of
        Korea Headquarters, which is the building donning the country's flag.
        Walking a bit down the road, we walked by a few common Pyongyang bus
        stops, one decorated in a beautiful sunset landscape and the other a
        winter battle scene.

        We also see one of the most iconic scenes of Pyongyang, the traffic
        girls. Since there are no traffic lights in Pyongyang, traffic is
        monitored and directed in a militaristic manner by these women, and
        rarely men. It is one of the most respected and revered jobs in the
        city. One of the most unexpected things I learned from this trip is that
        there is really little to no misogyny in the country and you can see
        women in all positions of power. There is one legendary traffic girl by
        the name of

        who received the “Hero of the Republic” award, which is the highest
        honor, in 2013 for a deed which is unknown, but apparently “displayed
        the heroic self-sacrificing spirit of safeguarding the security of the
        headquarters of the revolution in an unexpected circumstance,” according

        We then headed back to the buses and left to the southwest outskirts of
        the capital to the claimed birthplace of Kim Il Sung. It is a beautiful
        perfectly preserved large park area and near the center is a little
        yellow adobe looking hut with straw roofing. Here is supposedly his
        birthplace.

          >Pyongyang metro</a

        minute to go all the way down. That is because many of the stations in
        the metrosystem double as bomb shelters for the people. At the bottom
        are three beautiful murals. One at the end is aptly titled “The Great
        Leader Kim Il-sung Among Workers.” One on the left side is titled “A
        Morning of Innovation,” featuring workers at what I think is the nearby
        thermal power plant. The one on the right when you enter is titled “Song
        of a Bumper Crop,” which I did not get a picture of, since a metrocar
        was in the way, but I found a photo below elsewhere on the internet.

        Riding the rail cars was unexpectedly a very loud experience. You could
        not easily hold a conversation as it was going at nearly 70 km/h. The
        trains were built in the late 50s to early 60s for the West Berlin
        U-Bahn system and bought second hand by North Korea in 1999. Each car of
        course featured the portraits of Kim Il sung and Kim Jong Il to keep
        watch over the travelers. We took this train down one station to the
        Yonggwang station, getting out for some pictures of the scenic murals
        here, and to wave at the passing by workers and school children, which
        you see below.

        We hopped back on the following train and headed four more stops down
        the line to the Kaeson station, located under the Arch of Triumph. In
        this station is yet another inspirational mural titled “The People Rise
        up in the Building of a New Country”. It has since been refurbished in
        2019 with new lighting, TVs, and LED signs displaying the local weather.
        At the end of the station stood an illuminated golden statue of a young

        Now is actually a good time to mention the government's and people's
        foreign relations as I experienced in my travels there. In my time
        there, I recognized a deep hatred for Japan and the Japanese people
        there, largely due to the atrocities Japan had committed against all of
        the Korean people in the previous centuries. It is actually the only
        foreign nation that I felt the North Korean people actually had a deep
        seeded hatred of the foreign people as well as the government. In my
        experience as an American, I actually didn't feel like I got glances of
        hatred from the locals there, nor did I feel they were aggressive when I
        communicated with them. My assumption is that they despise our
        government, but not the people, aside from the ones that participated in
        the Korean war, as I will get to later. It feels similar to how much of
        the American public feels toward Russia in that we don't enjoy the
        people in power there, but are indifferent to the people. One thing that
        I found interesting there was actually the extreme longing for a
        reunification of the Korean peninsula. It is a true goal that all of the
        people and government want to work towards in my experience there, but
        of course they want it under the terms of a North Korean culture and
        philosophy, rather than a southern one.

        Next we headed west to the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorious_War_Museum"
          >Fatherland Liberation War Victory Museum</a
        >, which is a history museum dedicated to the Korean War. The outside
        square is adorned with statues of animated North Korean soldiers in
        battle and some structures covering a few American tanks, a helicopter,
        and a plane, which were recovered or shot down during the war. The
        museum sits against the Potong river in the capital and docked against
        the museum is the captured USS Pueblo on display.

        We visited the inside of the museum, but very unfortunately pictures
        were not allowed to be taken. This is probably one of the most
        fascinating parts of the trip to me. It sounds insane and an oxymoron to
        say this, but it is definitely one of the most well curated and put
        together museums I have ever seen, akin to a Smithsonian, but just about
        everything inside was just clearly dramatized fake history. It is so
        intriguing seeing our museum tour guide show us extremely detailed wax
        dioramas of a “common” Korean war scene of American soldiers eating
        North Korean babies, while speaking to a group with a couple Americans.
        It was so odd seeing her talk in deep hatred about these supposed
        atrocities we committed to the level of devouring infants, but between
        walking between halls and talking to her, there was no association in
        her mind to me being an American attached to these supposed atrocities.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        One piece of “history” on display there was memorabilia and claims of a
        sinking of our USS Baltimore, being torpedoed by their Navy, but our USS
        Baltimore was nowhere near the Korean War. The actual boat involved in
        the battle they describe was the USS Juneau, but it actually destroyed
        three of their torpedo boats without suffering any damage itself. It's
        quite hilarious to see such a lopsided portrayal of history. Skimming
        through books I find through the country, and the one I purchased, these
        false accounts are very common.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        The most impressive feature of the whole museum was a rotating room with
        a 360 panoramic cyclorama of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Taejon"
          >Battle of Taejon</a
        >. There are very few pictures from the interior of the museum in
        general, but I did find that someone was allowed to video a guide
        talking showing and talking about this cyclorama
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGgbY8QGCQ4">here</a>. It is
        actually more impressive than the video because here you just have the
        museum guide talking about the battle and cyclorama, but in our case, we
        sat on the bench as the lights dimmed, spinning us around the room for
        about five to ten minutes narrating the battle, shooting light and smoke
        around the panorama, while providing war sound ambiance. Credit where
        credit is due, North Korea can make a killer museum.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        After leaving the museum, we headed to the Juche tower, across the
        river. It is a large Washington Monument-esque tower with a large, red,
        permanently-illuminated red flame at the top. It is easily visible all
        around town to remind everyone, as if they needed it, to live a life
        consumed by the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juche">Juche philosophy</a>. As I
        noted previously the Juche philosophy is permanently and pervasively in
        the minds of every single North Korean. It is a unique variant of
        Marxism conceptualized by Kim Il Sung where the main ideas actually
        focus on self-reliance and independence. While Marxism famously endorses
        the working class owning the means of production and relying on fair
        distribution of its output, Juche truly encourages the individual and
        nation state to work towards independence and sovereignty. It is a much
        more nationalistic ideology than Marxism. Although they still struggle
        in achieving these goals and largely rely on trade with China, Russia,
        and African republics, you can see how having such a pervasive
        encouragement of working toward independence and heavy nationalism in
        its citizens has had some benefit to their success in keeping the regime
        alive to this day compared to formerly Marxist nations.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Usually, tour groups get a chance to ride the elevator to the top of the
        tower, but it was out of service for our visit. Just inside at the base
        of the tower are 82 plaques of famous foreign dignitaries and proponents
        of the Juche philosophy. Also near the base of the tower is a statue of
        three figures each holding a sickle, hammer, and writing brush. Directly
        across the river from the tower we see the library, residential
        buildings, and the pyramid hotel. We were also surprised with a passing
        by school band.

        >. It is a large stone monument consisting of a hammer, sickle, and
        writing brush held high in the sky, each representing the worker,
        farmer, and intellectual, respectively. It is lined on the inside with
        an inscribed mural of North Korean people standing up to the Japanese

        wear a red flag pin on the left side of their chest over their heart,
        which most of the population participates in. Directly across the river
        is the Mansu Hill Grand Monument which was our first stop of the morning
        and an ominous high-rising Ryugyong hotel in the background as dusk
        fell.

        We finish the evening with a trip to a local cinema to watch a locally
        made film. Kim Jong Il was famously an avid film fan, starring and
        directing in many films himself. I don't believe this one we saw, which
        I believe is the title screen below if I remember, was related to any of
        his work. If I remember it was a martial arts-esque action movie. If

      <hr />
      <h2>Day 4: September 11, 2016</h2>
      <p class="indent">
        Today was the day we got to escape the capital, and travel south to the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone">DMZ</a
        >. We got an early start and on our way out of town we stopped by the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_of_Reunification"
          >Arch of Reunification</a
        >. It towers above the Reunification Highway on the way from Pyongyang
        to the DMZ picturing two women holding a picture of the Korean
        peninsula, meant to commemorate a reunified Korea. As I mentioned
        before, the North Korean people actively want and long for a
        reunification of the peninsula, just with the demand that it be a
        culture and governed in the style of the North. As you can see, even the
        highways are barren and we could easily walk out and take a picture.
      </p>
      <img class="big-img" src="https://imagedelivery.net/kpjDIZy0BT0VX-Cr6PcgqA/2b9bf9a1-6c6a-44fb-73eb-f8fc285b8300/public" />
      <p class="indent">
        The drive to the DMZ was our best chance to observe life in the
        countryside. Although they seemingly strategically pushed the towns away
        far from the highway from tourists' eyes, you could see from the
        distance it was clearly decrepit. It was approximately an hour and a
        half drive, but cars are such a rare sight, I could probably count
        passing by less than ten the entirety of this trip on a multilane
        highway. Nobody in the countryside would ever be able to afford a car.
        Having a bike would be quite well off. It is for this reason in my first
        person experience there that I find it very odd that a common excuse for
        not liberating these people is that it would cause a mass migration of
        their population into China or the south. A vast majority of these
        people can not travel, unless by foot, and no, they do not have
        livestock like horses or mules to travel either. Interestingly, cannabis

        Halfway to the destination, we stopped for ten minutes at a rest stop,
        arching above the highway. Below are two pictures looking in both
        directions down the highway. Remember when we got in an accident
        earlier???

        Staying on the transportation topic, throughout our trips across the
        capital and countryside it was common to see monuments displaying the
        political propaganda and although we actually never stopped to see any,
        I tried to quickly snap a few pictures during my time there when we
        drove by any. Also a common site traveling around the bigger cities are
        people playing volleyball or basketball.

        Also, adorning the highway, particularly as we got closer to the DMZ
        were very large concrete towers with a cut out wedge near the base. This
        is to quickly lay explosives and block the highway from tanks and other
        vehicles during an oncoming invasion.

      <p class="indent">
        Finally, a mile from the border, we stopped at a small building, which
        we learned was the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea_Peace_Museum"
          >North Korea Peace Museum</a
        >. It is the building where the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Armistice_Agreement"
          >Korean War Armistice Agreement</a
        >
        was signed. The building was quite bare, containing three tables in the
        center with a copy of the agreement in a glass case. Along the walls
        hung various portraits and pictures of the Dear Leaders. Also, it housed
        the axe used by the Americans to cut down a large tree in the Joint
        Security Area (JSA), which resulted in a skirmish that killed US Army
        soldiers in the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_axe_murder_incident"

        After this quick stop, we headed the mile up the road to the JSA. We
        crossed the Bridge of 72 Hours parked right next to the Kim Il Sung Last
        Letter Monument below, which is the same spot that the North Korean
        defector,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Chong-song">Oh Chong-song</a>,
        departed his vehicle in the

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanmun_Pavilion"
          >Phanmun Pavilion</a
        >, behind the famous blue buildings on the border. Unfortunately, we
        were not able to visit the blue conference rooms, which is occasionally
        allowed. However, I did make a trip to the DMZ from the south in the
        summer of 2018 and visited the inside of the conference rooms, which is
        a trip report for a later date. We were allowed up to the balcony of the
        pavilion, which overlooked the border and took a picture with one of the
        guards there.

        After an exciting visit to the DMZ, we made our way to the large town
        ten minutes west called
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaesong">Kaesong</a> for lunch.
        Before lunch though, we went to the northern outskirts and stopped at a
        preserved 17th-century Confucian academy which housed traditional
        buildings, which held various pottery and relics of the time, which was
        quite peaceful.

        All that I remember from lunch was that it was a fancier place, with a
        beautiful mural. I do remember that the meal had an optional upcharge
        for dog-meat, non-domesticated dog, which is a delicacy they refer to
        locally as “sweet meat”. Being an avid dog person, although it was not
        domesticated, I could not stomach or justify ordering such a meal. I'm
        sure I just ordered another dish of cold noodles.

        The exterior of the restaurant sat against the main road of the city,

        As we left Kaesong to the northwest was the

          >Mausoleum of King Wang Kon</a
        >, a tomb belonging to the founder of the Goryeo Dynasty in the mid
        10th-century. The tomb was largely destroyed during the Japanese
        occupation, but has since been restored. This was actually one of the
        most beautiful parts of my trip here in North Korea and I think of it
        fondly. It was mesmerizing looking at the rolling hills through the
        statues lining the steps to the tomb.

        Our last stop on the way back to Pyongyang was a park in

        around for about half an hour, to take pictures and see a nice view of

      <hr />
      <h2>Day 5: September 12, 2016</h2>
      <p class="indent">
        We woke up early the next morning to head to the airport, taking a
        flight back to Beijing. Amusingly, I have pictures and remember seeing
        the two movies below for sale at a gift shop in the airport. They must
        be a hit in North Korea if there's a sequel.
      </p>
      <div class="half">

        Boarding the flight I took the newspaper and was shocked by what was
        inside. Being in North Korea, you hear nothing of what goes on inside
        the country, unless you know Korean and watched the news or read the
        local paper. This also meant that I had no idea what went on in the rest
        of the world. I read in this english newspaper of the Pyongyang Times
        that on September 9, my first full day in the country and the Grand
        National Day, that North Korea had tested an underground nuclear bomb.
        This was the fifth time they have done so,
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea"
          >out of the six times in history</a
        >. It was obviously big news around the world and likely in the country,
        but I had no awareness of it for many days. When I look at the time that
        nuclear bomb went off and crossreference it with the timestamps of my
        photos that day, it went off during the time I was in the Kumsusan
        Palace of the Sun, which was the mausoleum displaying the bodies of the
        past Dear Leaders. It is surreal and frightening to think that I could
        have been bowing before these dictators at the exact same time that the
        nation was exploding their fifth ever nuclear bomb.

      <h2>Day +1: September 13, 2016</h2>
      <p class="indent">
        Although my trip had concluded by this day, I want to finish the trip
        report similarly to how it started, with another fiasco related to my
        North Korea travels involving China. In the evening of this day, I was
        sitting in my hostel in Beijing having a cheeseburger in the hostel
        owned restaurant/bar on the ground floor, in eye sight of reception.
        During my meal, in walked a group of four Chinese policemen who started
        to converse with the receptionist. The receptionist looked in my
        direction, left the desk, and approached me. Apparently these officers
        wanted to see my passport. My heart immediately started racing. In my
        research on the safety of traveling to North Korea, I never read of any
        issues related to China's perception of travel there. My heart started
        beating fast. Thoughts started racing through my mind of if I'd have to
        end up calling the US embassy from a Chinese prison that night. I didn't
        even know the number to do so if I needed to.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        I nervously left my meal on the table, shuffled up the stairs past the
        officers up to my room. I grabbed my passport out of my bag and headed
        back downstairs to them. I was shaking while handing my passport to the
        one seemingly in charge. He spent about two minutes, but what felt like
        a century flipping through my pages and taking notes in his little
        notebook. He didn't talk to me, just diligently took notes. Finally, he
        handed my passport back, and they turned around and left, without saying
        a word. I was quite on edge for a while after that and stayed at the bar
        for a little while afterward to order more drinks, understandably.
